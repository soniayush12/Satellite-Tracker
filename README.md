#🌍 3D Earth Satellite Tracker using Real-Time API Integration#

Duration: June 2025
Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Three.js, Node.js, Express.js, N2YO API, WebGL

Project Overview:
Built an interactive 3D web application to track real satellites (like ISS, Starlink, Hubble) on a virtual Earth globe. The system fetches real-time satellite positional data using the N2YO satellite tracking API and visually maps it using Three.js and three-globe.

Key Features:

🔭 Real-time satellite visualization in a 3D WebGL environment.

🛰️ Displays satellite names, current positions, and live trajectory trails.

🌐 Developed a Node.js Express proxy server to bypass browser CORS issues for authenticated API calls.

📍 Converts satellite latitude/longitude into 3D vectors on a rotating Earth model.

🕹️ Integrated OrbitControls for smooth user interaction and camera navigation.

What I Learned:

API authentication & CORS handling with Node.js

3D transformations with spherical coordinates

Real-time rendering optimization

Satellite telemetry basics
